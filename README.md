## Name
StaffX

## Version Support
Only support 1.13 and above, I do ASK that you update to 1.18 as old versions are just not optimal to play in.

## Want to contribute?
Create a fork of StaffX and submit a pull request ( Please review your code, Any pull request in Java will be closed but I'll merge it manually in kotlin)

## Description
Spent quite a bit of my time looking around on Mc-Market/Spigot which were either not updated, updated but not what I wanted, updated but just terrible. I decided that enough was enough and wrote a simplistic version in Kotlin. 

## Features
  Random Teleport GUI bound to the Random tool item
  A little special effect you get on vanish on/off or /staff exit/enter, Can be toggled off in the config.
  A freeze tool
  Custom tools with commands
  Saving locations across worlds and teleporting you back to them when done.

## Roadmap
